  "presentation": "Born in 1990 in Reunion Island, France, I had the opportunity to live in many countries: Congo, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, French Guyana and South Korea. These experiences have opened my mind and increased my ability to adapt to new situations. Through a regular practice of fitness activities and E-sport, I learned precision, consistency, competitiveness. I want to challenge myself by improving my learning skills to be a real asset in my working place.",
